Aim: - Introduction to structured threat modeling. - Apply the CIA triad and STRIDE/DREAD frameworks. - Develop a Python tool to simulate attack tree scoring.

Tasks:

Analyze a fictional smart home IoT system (e.g., with devices like a smart lock, thermostat, and voice assistant).
Identify and document key assets, attacker profiles (internal, external), trust boundaries, entry/exit points, and data flows.
Construct an attack tree using a graphing tool (e.g., Graphviz or draw.io). Annotate each node with potential impact and likelihood.
Implement a Python script that ingests a JSON or YAML representation of threats and outputs risk rankings based on STRIDE or DREAD
Extend the attack tree model to include Bayesian inference or Monte Carlo simulations for dynamic threat probability estimation (for grade 4 and 5).
 

Deliverables:

Executable Python script(s).
A lab report containing:
A threat model diagram (digital format);
A working Python-based risk scoring tool with example inputs/outputs examples;
Reflections on mitigation priorities and proposed controls (technical and policy-based).
